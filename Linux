Steps to Connect to EC2 Instance:
******************************************************************

On windows Laptop

> Open Cmd prompt
> go to the directory where your key pair file → .pem file is present
  
 Execute Command :      cd downloads/

Go back to AWS instance

Copy the example command:

ssh -i "15oct.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-234-155-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Give yes and press enter.



On Mac laptop

> Open terminal
> go to the directory where your key pair file → .pem file is present
  
 Command :      cd downloads/

Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
 chmod 400 <filename.pem>

Example: chmod 400 16july.pem

Copy the example command:

ssh -i "16july.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-234-155-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Give yes and press enter.




Linux Commands:
******************************************************************

Linux commands are case sensitive.

To check the OS

            # uname

Check the OS distribution and its version

# cat /etc/os-release

Clear the screen

# clear 

.Print the working directory

# pwd

History command:

	# history

Become the root user:
$ sudo su -

Check different  users already present on Linux OS:

# cat /etc/passwd


Lets create a new user in linux OS
         
          # adduser devopsuser


Set password for the user

# passwd devopsuser

Changing password for user devopsuser.
New password: devopsuser
Retype password: devopsuser

Check the user details in OS

# cat /etc/passwd


Switch to the user devopsuser

# su - devopsuser

===========================================

Create your own directory

$ mkdir myfiles

Change the directory to myfiles

 $ cd myfiles

Create an Empty file

$ touch file1

To list the files in a directory

	$ ls 

Add content in the file:
==========================================
$ echo “This is my first file” > file1

$ cat file1   ⇒ used to print the contents of the file


Append lines in to the file using echo
================================

$ echo “hello everyone” >> file1

====================================


Use Linux editors to create a file, add content to the file and save the file


> vim editor  (all the devops tool training)


This editor comes by default in the linux OS

$ vim file2.txt

Press enter key

This command will open an editor file


Press i  ⇒ to insert any data

Enter this text as an example:

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working


To Save the file :
 
Press ESC key on your keyboard

And give the keys

:wq

And press ENTER key to complete the operation

Display contents of the file:

$ cat file2


Touch : it is a command that creates an empty file

# touch file3.txt

Echo : it is a command print any text on the command line or enter any text in the file


Assignment:
==================
Cat command to create files:
*************************
Creating small files with cat it often easier than opening a text editor such as nano , Vim

To create a new file, use the cat command followed by the redirection operator (>) and the name of the file you want to create. Press Enter, type the text and once you are done, press the CRTL+D to save the file.
In the following example, we are creating a new file named file1.txt:
# cat > file1.txt
Assignment:
=================================
Suppose if a file named file1.txt is already present, Use the ‘>>’ operator to append the output to an existing file.
# cat >> file1.txt
=======================================
Permissions of a file
Remove write permission for current user

$  chmod u-w newfile

Add executable permission to current user

$  chmod u+x newfile



Remove or Add permission for users of same group

$ chmod g+w newfile

$  chmod g-w newfile

Remove or Add permission for all other users

$ chmod a+w newfile

$  chmod a-w newfile


U → file owner
G -> group users
A -> others (everbody else)



Read ⇒ 4
Write => 2
Execute 1


U → file owner  ⇒ 6
G -> group users ⇒ 4
A -> others (everybody else) => 4


$  chmod 644 newfile










Make a copy of an exisitng file

# cp sourcefile newfilename

# cp file1 copiedfile

# ls

# cat copiedfile

file content will be same

	

Move file form 1 directory to another

Lets move file1 from myfiles directory to tmp directory of linux OS

	Syntax: mv filename /destainationpath

# mv file1 /tmp/file1


files will be not copied but moved to new directory or location


tail command

# tail file1

will print only last 10 lines of the file

or

# tail -n 5 file1 ==> print only last 5 lines of the file




head command

Syntax: head filename

will print only first 10 lines of the file

# head -n 5 filename

will print only first 5 lines of the file


Grep command

Used to search for characters in a file and present it to you

create a file 

# vim filenew

This is my file for devops
created by sonal for devops
sonal is teaching Linux
We are learning Linux commands for devops

Press ESC key and enter the below keys
:wq!

Execute command
# grep devops filenew  ==> give only that content of file highlighting devops

This is my file for devops
created by sonal for devops
We are learning Linux commands for devops


=============================

Process commands in Linux

there are 2 commands:

top command : will give all running process in your oS ==> Live current status

ps command: gives snapshot/ list of all current process

ps aux : shows process by all users, displays the process user/owner, shows process not attached to an app


ps -l -u ec2-user : list all process by a user

kill a process:

# pkill -9 pid

# pkill -u ec2-user




==================================


History command

What are the users in my operating system:
$  cat /etc/passwd

Create a new user in linux OS

$ useradd alice

You will get permission denial error

You will have to become a super user (root user)

How do you become a super user

*** $ sudo su -     

Now Create a new user in linux OS

$ useradd alice

alice:x:1001:1001::/home/alice:/bin/bash

Alice : user
X : no password has been set for user
1001: user id
1001: group id
/home/alice : home directory
/bin/bash: shell
